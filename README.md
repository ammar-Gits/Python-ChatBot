## Advanced Mobile Product Analysis and Interactive Chatbot System
# Project Overview
This project involves web scraping mobile product data from daraz.pk, developing an interactive chatbot, and presenting insights through a Flask-based dashboard. The system extracts detailed mobile phone information, stores it using SQLAlchemy, and enables user interaction via an intelligent chatbot.
